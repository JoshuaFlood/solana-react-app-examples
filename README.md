<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are working examples of mostly everything you will find here in various places across the internet. If you are just starting out and have stumbled across these examples whilst looking for learning resources, please understand that they are intended as copypasta and should only be used as such once you understand how they work. Please scroll to the <a href="#acknowledgements">Acknlowedgements section</a> where you will find links to various learning resources. Specifically, Cristina Solana's [developer resources repo](https://github.com/CristinaSolana/solana-developer-resources) provides an in-depth explanation of the majority of these examples and the repository is being regularly updated.

Remember, we're still early, so if you find any issues, see anything which could be improved or if you create an updated version of these examples with any new technology which arises, then please make a PR with your improvements or get in touch!

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap your project. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.

* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
* [web3.js](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/javascript-api)
* [Anchor](https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/getting-started/introduction.html)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

Pre-requisites listed are for all examples. Specific examples may require additional set-up and you should refer to the individual README.md file of each example to 
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo into your home directory
   ```sh
   $ cd
   $ git clone https://github.com/JoshuaFlood/solana-react-app-examples.git
   ```
2. Create a new directory in your desired folder
   ```sh
   $ cd
   $ mkdir my-custom-project
   ```
3. Copy all files from your desired example into your new project folder
   ```sh
   $ cp -r solana-react-app-examples/example-1/* my-custom-project/
   ```
4. Move into your project directory and install the example application using Node Package Manager (NPM) - if you are using Yarn then replace `npm install` with `yarn add` or `yarn install`, depending on which version of Yarn is installed.
   ```js
   $ cd solana-react-app-examples
   $ npm install
   ```

_At this stage, check the README.md file that you just copied into your project to ensure that you have satisfied all pre-requisites and then test the app with `npm run start` or deploy it with `npm run build`._
